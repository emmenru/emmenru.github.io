She is funded by a Vetenskapsrådet (Swedish Research Council) International Postdoctoral Grant hosted by the Sound and Music Computing group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
      Emma obtained a PhD in Sound and Music Computing from the Division of Media Technology and Interaction Design at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in January 2020. 
      Her thesis was titled <i>"Diverse Sounds - Enabling Inclusive Sonic Interaction"</i> and focused on how Sonic Interaction Design can be used to promote inclusion and diversity in music-making. 
      Emma is the author of the first full <a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/mti3030057'>review on Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs)</a>. Her research interests include Sonic Interaction Design (SID), inclusive music technology and practice, multimodal interface design, Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-AI Interaction (HAI), and haptics.
      Emma holds a Master’s of Science in Engineering in Media Technology from KTH Royal Institute of Technology. In 2014, she was a graduate research trainee at Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL), McGill University, 
      where she completed a Master’s Thesis project on vibrotactile feedback for live electronics. In 2019, Emma worked as an Audio Research Intern at the Adobe Creative Intelligence Lab in San Francisco, 
      where she focused on interfaces supporting AI Music generation. 
      When Emma is not working with sound and music research, she is playing the violin and the piano, taking <a href='https://emserpics.tumblr.com/'>pictures</a>, or hanging out with her cat.
